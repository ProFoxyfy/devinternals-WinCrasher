Simple windows crasher for debugging purposes.

# Manual Building
(This shouldn't be too hard.)

1. Download .NET Framework 4.0 if it isn't installed. (already comes with windows 10+)
2. Download the source code
3. Open with an Code Editor (VS Code recommended)
4. Add .NET Framework Binaries to PATH,
This can be achieved using the control panel.
("C:\Windows\Microsoft.NET\Framework\v4.0.30319")

With that done build.bat should work fine.
